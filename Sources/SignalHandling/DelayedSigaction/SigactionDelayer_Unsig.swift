	**Example**: If you register a dispatch source signal for the signal 15 but
	does not ensure signal 15 is ignored, when you receive this signal your
	program will stop because the default handler for this signal is to quit.
	
	All unsigaction IDs must be released for the original sigaction to be set on
	the signal again.
	
	- Note: On Linux, the `DispatchSourceSignal` does change the `sigaction` for
	the signal: https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-libdispatch/pull/560
