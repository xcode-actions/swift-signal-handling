/**
A way to delay the sigaction for a given signal until arbitrary handlers have
allowed it. Use with care. You should understand how the delaying works before
using this.

First, to delay a sigaction, you have to bootstrap the signals you’ll want to
delay, **before any other threads are created**. Technically you can bootstrap
any signals you want, including those you won’t need to delay, but to avoid some
potentially nasty side-effects, you should only ever bootstrap the signals you
will need to delay.

At bootstrap time, all the bootstrapped signals are blocked on the calling
thread (which should be the main thread as the bootstrap must be called before
any other thread are created). Then a thread is spawned, in which the
bootstrapped signals are unblocked. These signals can now only be processed by
this thread.

When the first handler is registered for a given signal, we instruct the thread
to block the given signal. Whenever the signal is received, we are notified via
GCD, and then tell the thread to receive the signal via `sigsuspend`.

A (big) caveat: _From what I understand_, when all threads are blocking a given
signal, the system has to choose which thread to send the signal to. And it
might not be the one we have chosen to process signals… so we sometimes have to
re-send the signal to our thread! In which case we lose the info in `siginfo_t`,
and a thread is stuck with a pending signal forever…

- Important: An important side-effect of this technique is if a bootstrapped
signal is then sent to a specific thread, the signal will be blocked. Forever.
Because of this, you really should not bootstrap whatever signal you want. For
example, the `SIGILL` signal (illegal instruction) is sent to the offending
thread, not the process. If you use it for a delayed sigaction, when the signal
is sent, the thread that triggered that signal will block forever (all signals
bootstrapped are blocked on all threads except the internal thread). */

	Delayed sigaction is done by blocking delayed signals until the time has come

	If any thread does not block the delayed signal, the sigaction will be called

	- Note: How do we know a signal has arrived if it is blocked? We use
	libdispatch to be notified when a new signal arrives. libdispatch uses kqueue
	on BSD and signalfd on Linux. Signals are still sent to kqueue and signalfd
	when they are blocked, so it works.
